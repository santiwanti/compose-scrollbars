# Compose Scrollbars

Compose Scrollbars is a library that allows adding scrollbars that are linked to a LazyList or a  
Pager. 

## Usage

Import the Compose Scrollbars dependency (add code snippet for gradle)

The library includes easy to use functions `ListScrollbar` and `PagerScrollbar` and a more generic
function simply called `Scrollbar`. This last function could potentially be used to add a scrollbar
to something that is not a list.

The positioning and appearance of the scrollbars are implemented by the caller giving the option to
set the scrollbar on top of the list or around it.
